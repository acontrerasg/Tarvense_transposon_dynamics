**Snapshots are stored here.**
Here we deposited the snapsots used to manually validate a fraction of identified TIPs.
In total, we evalyated 2448 TIPs. 1744 of those were true positives (71%), 518 false positives and 183 ambigous. 

In order to manually validate our TIPs we  manually inspected a subset of TIPs in three categories: <br>
  True positives: If the TIP was valid. <br>
  False positives: If the TIP was wrong. <br>
  Ambiguous: If we were not confident about its classification. <br>

Folders are orgganized as follows:
- First level organizes files by region: `AM CN DE FR SE NL FR US` <br>
- Second level organizes files by classification result: `01_True_pos 02_False_pos 03_ambigous`
