**Snapshots are stored here.**

In order to manually validate our TIPs we  manually inspected a subset of TIPs in three categories: 
  True positives: If the TIP was valid.
  False positives: If the TIP was wrong.
  Ambiguous: If we were not confident about its classification.
 
 

Folders are orgganized as follows:
- First level organizes files by region: `AM CN DE FR SE US` <br>
- Second level organizes files by classification result:  `01_True_pos 02_False_pos 03_ambigous`
