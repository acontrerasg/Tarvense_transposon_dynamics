# Tarvense_transposon_dynamics

This repository contains code to generate and curate the data of transposon insertion polymorphysms (TIPs) and transposon absence polymorphysms (TAPs) in large cohorts of accessions, using illumina short reads

[Reference_TE_description](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/Reference_TE_description) <br/>
Contains  a collection of scripts used to  phylogenetically characterize the TE models present in the reference, as well as the evaluation of their protein domains into autonomous/non-autonomous. 

[SNP_scripts](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/SNP_scripts) <br/>
Contains scripts related to the broad clustering of the accessions usingg SNP data (PCA and TREEMIX).

[TIP_calling_evaluation](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/TIP_calling_evaluation) <br/>
Contains the pipeline used to curate the TIPs.  

[TAP_calling_evaluation](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/TAP_calling_evaluation) <br/>
Contains the pipeline used to curate the TAPs.

[PAVs_analysis](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/PAVs_analysis) <br/>
Contains scripts to generate and visualize two TIP/TAP presence/absence matrices and the saturation curve analysis of TIPS.

[TIP_methylation](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/TIP_methylation) <br/>
Contains scripts to plot DNA methylation in the flanking regions of TE insertions in samples with vs without the insertion.

[GWAS](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/GWAS) <br/>
Contains scripts to perform GWAS analisis with short read data using TIPs as phenotype. 

[TIP_methylation](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/TIP_methylation) <br/>
Contains scripts to plot DNA methylation in the flanking regions of TE insertions in samples with vs without the insertion.

[TE_family](https://github.com/acontrerasg/Tarvense_transposon_dynamics/tree/main/TE_family) <br/>
Contains the scripts used to characterize the TE family across Brassicaceae and find the HRE motif.
