Here we  have the scripts we sued to generate several datasets related to SNP data:
- Short variant calling, filtering and imputation was performed using [this](https://github.com/Dario-Galanti/BinAC_varcalling) repository, as in a previous [publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010452)
- Ancestry ( A colllection of scripts to create a dataset and run treemix based on the SNP file generated previously)
- SNP_PCA ( Scripts used to do, and visualize a PCA based on the SNPS)
